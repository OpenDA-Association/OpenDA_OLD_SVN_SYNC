# There is an issue with gfortran 4.6. The flag of the dependent libraries is not correctly handled by automake/autoconf
# This results in (-l <libnane> and not -l<libname>). After all processing the compiler tries to link with -l wich causes errors.
# This fix is inspired by a post of Roger Ferrer Ib치침ez (http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-libtool/2012-03/msg00004.html).

# Users should not use the "normal" autoconf after chanes but used this script.

autoreconf
# Copy the generated configure script such that we have a back-up
cp configure configure_org

# Change the processing of the link flags, we just remove "-l " if it appears. 
# This is probably not a very generic fix but it works for OpenDA.
